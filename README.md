# Folder Sizer
 A simple cli tool that scans a given directory and lists its subfolders sorted by size. Has a bunch of nice features like selecting a subfolder for further scanning, saving the list into a text file, opening the current folder in explorer, and more.
 
 It's pretty useful when trying to clean out drive space on Windows, because explorer doesn't let you sort folders by size.
